# AIO: All-In-One Python Mini-Game Collection
## A Nostalgic Arcade of Classic Text-Based Games
This repository contains one of my early passion projects: a single Python application that serves as a launcher for a variety of classic mini-games. The goal was to build a fun, all-in-one arcade experience and to challenge myself by implementing the logic for several different types of games within a single, organized codebase.

This project was a foundational step in my game development journey, where I honed my skills in core programming logic, user input handling, and application structure using Python.

### ðŸŽ® Games Included
This collection features a variety of small arcade and text-based games, including:

* **Hangman:** The classic word-guessing game.

* **Tic-Tac-Toe:** A two-player grid game.

* **Timer:** A simple timer.

* **Converters:** Simple unit converters.

### ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python

Lessons Learned
Building this project was an excellent exercise in fundamental game logic and modular code design. Each mini-game presented a unique logical challenge, from state management in Tic-Tac-Toe to string manipulation in Hangman.
